  # This is a sample workflow, feel free to replace it with your source code

  # This workflow does the following:
  # - reads current time and date information from an external API and stores
  #   the response in CurrentDateTime variable
  # - retrieves a list of Wikipedia articles related to the day of the week
  #   from CurrentDateTime
  # - returns the list of articles as an output of the workflow
  # FYI, In terraform you need to escape the $$ or it will cause errors.
